Greetings. 

Here lies the code repo for one of my two Ph.D projects. The paper, entitled "A Model for Image Segmentation in Retina" can be found here. https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02567

The purpose of this repo is to provide a sample of my coding capabilities - not to provide a working project that can be picked up by others without significant effort.
